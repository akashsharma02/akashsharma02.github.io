I assembled and built the <a href="https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/">Sofle Keyboard v2</a> for fun. I was getting into ergonomic keyboards at the time, and did not want to pay the premium for something such as the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/keyboards/advantage2-keyboard/">Kinesis Advantage 2</a>

    The keyboard kit came with 2 PCBs and a set of switch holders, which needed to be soldered per keyswitch. (left) My wife helping me out with soldering (right) Finished PCB after

Once the soldering was complete, I also attached two QMK controller boards for each half of the keyboard. I use the knob on the keyboard to scroll pages or to control the audio volume. I also experimented with two sets of keyswitches: Gateron MX yellow and Gateron MX (speed) silver. I ended up keeping the MX silver, and moved the yellow switches to my secondary keyboard that I use at home.

All in all, this turned out to be both successful and fun! I use this keyboard as my daily driver and absolutely enjoy the light switches which helps finger fatigue, and also the many conversations it has started in my office.
