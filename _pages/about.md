Hey there!

I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  My research focuses on long term robotic mapping and 3D reconstruction for scene understanding through graph-based SLAM. At CMU, I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cs.cmu.edu/~kaess">Prof. Michael Kaess</a> and collaborate with <a href="https://shubhtuls.github.io/">Shubham Tulsiani</a>.

I graduated with a Masters in Robotics from CMU (<a href='assets/pdf/msr_thesis.pdf'>Thesis</a>). Before joining CMU, I spent two years as a Software Engineer at Infinera, where I helped build infrastructure for fault-tolerant optical communications, that manages long-haul internet traffic. I received a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE).

I'm a <img src="{{ '/assets/img/Icon-Vim.svg' | relative_url }}" width="20"/> enthusiast, my lua configuration is available [here](https://github.com/akashsharma02/neovim-config/). I also enjoy mechanical keyboards, and I currently use a custom built keyboard [Sofle Keyboard](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
