Hey there!

I am a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  My research focuses on long term robotic mapping and 3D reconstruction for scene understanding through graph-based SLAM. At CMU, I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cs.cmu.edu/~kaess">Prof. Michael Kaess</a>.

I graduated with a Masters from CMU recently. Before joining CMU, I spent two years as a Software Engineer at Infinera, where I helped build infrastructure for fault-tolerant optical communications, that manages long-haul internet traffic. I received a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE) in 2017.

I'm a <img src="{{ '/assets/img/Icon-Vim.svg' | relative_url }}" width="20"/> enthusiast, my lua configuration is available [here](https://github.com/akashsharma02/neovim-config/). I also enjoy mechanical keyboards, and I am currently building the [Sofle Keyboard](https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/).
