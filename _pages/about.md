Hey there!

I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://cs.cmu.edu">School of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a> advised by <a href="https://cs.cmu.edu/~kaess">Prof. Michael Kaess</a> and a visiting researcher at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/">FAIR, Meta</a>, where I collaborate with <a href="https://www.mustafamukadam.com">Mustafa Mukadam</a>.  My research focuses broadly on enabling robot perception and state estimation across different sensing modalities such as vision and touch.

I graduated with a Masters in Robotics from CMU (<a href='assets/pdf/msr_thesis.pdf'>Thesis</a>). Before joining CMU, I was briefly a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.infinera.com">Infinera</a>. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication from <a href="https://jssstuniv.in/#/">Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE)</a>.

I'm a <img src="{{ '/assets/img/Icon-Vim.svg' | relative_url }}" width="20"/> enthusiast, my lua configuration is available [here](https://github.com/akashsharma02/neovim-config/). I also enjoy mechanical keyboards, and I currently use a custom built keyboard [Sofle Keyboard](projects/sofle-keyboard).
