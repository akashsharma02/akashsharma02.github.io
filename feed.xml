Their use can range from pedestrian tracking with cheap IMUs to maintaining state for rockets with expensive and accurate IMUs. Therefore, I’ve been fascinated with IMU navigation for a while. In this writeup, I cover the basics required to understand inertial navigation for robot state estimation, and also explain the motivation behind IMU pre-integration<d-cite key="forster2016manifold"></d-cite>, the defacto way to deal with inertial measurements in visual-inertial SLAM.</p> <p>Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) are typically used to track the position and orientation of an object body relative to a known starting position, orientation and velocity. Two configurations of inertial navigation are common <d-cite key="woodman2007introduction"></d-cite>:</p> <ol> <li>a stable platform system where the inertial unit is placed in the global coordinate frame and does not move along with the body, and</li> <li>a strapdown navigation system where the inertial unit is rigidly attached to the moving object i.e., the IMU is in the body coordinate frame.</li> </ol> <p>These devices typically contain</p> <ol> <li><strong>Gyroscopes</strong> which measure the angular velocity of the body, denoted \({}_b\omega_k\) for angular velocity of the body frame \(b\) at a time instant \(k\)</li> <li><strong>Accelerometers</strong> which measure the resultant linear acceleration acting on its body, typically denoted with \({}_b a_k\) similarly in the body frame \(b\) at time instant \(k\)</li> </ol> <h2 id="a-micro-micro-lie-theory-review">A (micro) micro lie-theory review</h2> <p>An expert reader may choose to skip this section, however this section is important to understand the underlying math and motivation behind IMU pre-integration.

A Lie Group has identical curvature at every point on the manifold (imagine a circle for example).</p> <p>Some examples:</p> <ul> <li>\(\mathbb{R}^n\) is a Lie group under the group composition operation of <em>addition</em>.</li> <li>The General Linear Real matrix group, the set of all \(n \times n\) invertible matrices \(\mathbb{GL}(n, \mathbb{R}) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n^2}\) is a Lie group under <em>matrix multiplication</em></li> <li>The unit complex number group \(\text{S}^1: \mathbf{z} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta = e^{i\theta}\) under <em>complex multiplication</em> forms a Lie group. The unit norm of the complex numbers forms a 1-sphere or circle in \(\mathbb{R}^2\)</li> <li>The three sphere \(\text{S}^3 \subset \mathbb{R}^4\) is a lie group, we identify with quaternions \(\mathbb{H} \triangleq \{\text{x}_0 + \text{x}_1 i + \text{x}_2 j + \text{x}_3 k \}\) (\(\mathbb{H}\) read as Hamiltonian) under the <em>quaternion multiplication</em> forms a Lie group</li> </ul> <details><summary>2-sphere is not a Lie group</summary> <p>Note that the 2-sphere \(\text{S}^2\) is not a Lie Group, since we cannot define a group composition operator over it. To understand this, let us consider the <em>hairy ball theorem</em> <d-cite key="hairy2024wiki"></d-cite>, which roughly states that if you consider a sphere with hair on it, an attempt to comb all the hair such that all of them are pointing in a certain direction will fail and there will exist at least one vanishing point. More formally, there is no non-vanishing continous tangent space on \(\text{S}^2\). This implies that we cannot define a smooth function that can act as a group composition operator on this differentiable manifold.</p> </details> <h3 id="lie-group-action">Lie Group Action</h3> <p>Elements of the Lie group can act on elements from other sets. For example, a unit quaternion \(\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{H}\) acts on a vector \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3\) through quaternion multiplication to cause its rotation \(\mathbb{H} \times \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3 : \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{q}^*\).</p> <h3 id="tangent-space-and-the-lie-algebra">Tangent space and the Lie Algebra</h3> <p>Let \(\mathcal{X}(t)\) be a point on the Lie manifold \(\mathcal{M}\), then taking its time derivative we obtain \(\dot{\mathcal{X}} = \frac{d\mathcal{X}}{dt}\) which belongs to its tangent space at \(\mathcal{X}\) (or roughly linearized at \(\mathcal{X}\)) denoted as \(T_\mathcal{X}\mathcal{M}\). Since we note that the lie group has the same curvature throughout the manifold, the tangent space \(T_{\mathcal{X}}\mathcal{M}\) also has the same structure everywhere. In fact, by definition every Lie group of dimension \(n\) must have a tangent space described by \(n\) basis elements \(\{\text{E}_1 \dots \text{E}_n\}\) (sometimes also called <em>generators</em>) for \(T_\mathcal{X}\mathcal{M}\).</p> <p>For instance, the tangent space for the unit complex number group \(\text{S}^1\) is the tangent to a circle at any point forming a straight line i.e., \(\in \mathbb{R}^1\).</p> <p>The <strong>Lie Algebra</strong> then is simply the tangent space of a Lie group – linearized – at the identity element \(\mathcal{E}\) of the group. Every Lie group \(\mathcal{M}\) has an associated lie algebra \(\mathfrak{m} \triangleq T_\mathcal{E}\mathcal{M}\). The Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{m}\) is a vector space.</p> <details><summary>\(\wedge\) and \(\vee\) operators</summary> <p>We can also define functions that convert the tangent space elements between their vector space representation \(\mathbb{R}^m\) and their structured space \(\mathfrak{m}\) using the \(\text{hat}\) and \(\text{vee}\) operators.</p> <ul> <li> \[\wedge: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathfrak{m}; \tau \rightarrow \tau^\wedge = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \tau_i \text{E}_i\] </li> <li> \[\vee: \mathfrak{m} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m; \tau^{\wedge} \rightarrow (\tau^{\wedge})^{\vee} = \tau = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \tau_i \text{e}_i\] </li> </ul> <p>where let’s signify \(\text{e}_i\) as the basis elements of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). In this article, I will largely attempt to not make use of these operators in an attempt to keep the math concise, and in most cases the variant of Lie algebra used is apparent from context.</p> </details> <h3 id="mathbfexp-and-mathbflog-map">\(\mathbf{exp}\) and \(\mathbf{log}\) map</h3> <p>Now, we may define two operators to navigate between Lie group and the Lie algebra as follows:</p> <ul> <li>\(\text{exp}: T_\mathcal{X}\mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}\) a map that retracts (takes) elements on the tangent vector space to the Lie Group space <em>exactly</em>. Intuitively, the \(\text{exp}\) operator wraps the tangent element onto the Lie group manifold.</li> <li>Similarly \(\text{log}: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow T_\mathcal{X}\mathcal{M}\) a map that takes elements on the group to its tangent vector space element.</li> </ul> <p>The \(\text{exp}\) naturally arises when considering the time derivative, or an infinitesimal tangent increment \(v \in T_\mathcal{X}\mathcal{M}\) per unit time on the group manifold:</p> <p>\(\begin{align} \frac{d\mathcal{X}}{dt} &amp;= \mathcal{X}{v} \\ \frac{d\mathcal{X}}{\mathcal{X}} &amp;= v~dt \\ \text{integrating} \implies \mathcal{X}(t) &amp;= \mathcal{X}(0) \text{exp}(vt) \\ \implies \text{exp}(vt) &amp;= \mathcal{X}(0)^{-1}\mathcal{X}(t) \in \mathcal{M} \end{align}\) i.e., \(\text{exp}(vt)\) is a group element.</p> <details><summary>Properties of the \(\text{exp}\) map</summary> <p>The \(\text{exp}\) map satisfies a few important properties which are useful to know</p> <ul> <li> \[\text{exp}((t + s) \tau) = \text{exp}(t \tau) \text{exp}(s \tau)\] </li> <li> \[\text{exp}(t\tau) = \text{exp}(\tau)^t\] </li> <li> \[\text{exp}(-\tau) = \text{exp}(\tau)^{-1}\] </li> <li> \[\begin{align}\text{exp}(\mathcal{X} \tau \mathcal{X}^{-1}) = \mathcal{X} \text{exp}(\tau) \mathcal{X}^{-1} \label{eq:adjoint_property}\end{align}\] </li> </ul> <p>Where the last property is quite important, which I understand as: the exponential map is a no-op for elements already on the Lie manifold</p> </details> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ideal_imu_navigation.png" sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ideal_imu_navigation.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> An illustration of Lie Group definitions and operations with the unit complex group $\text{S}^1$ as the example </div> <h3 id="mathbfso3-example">\(\mathbf{SO(3)}\) example</h3> <p>The group of rotations \(\mathbf{SO}(3)\) is a matrix group of size 9 operating on \(\mathbb{R}^3\), with the following constraints:</p> <ul> <li>It is invertible \(\implies \mathbf{SO(3)} \subseteq \mathbb{GL}(3)\)</li> <li>It is orthogonal i.e., it has a determinant of \(\pm\) 1 \(\implies \mathbf{SO}(3) \subseteq \mathbf{O}(3)\)</li> <li>It is special orthogonal i.e., determinant is strictly \(+1\) i.e., reflections are not possible.</li> </ul> <p>For this group, we have the special orthogonality condition which can be written as:</p> \[\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I} = \mathbf{R}^\top \mathbf{R}\] <p>since \(\mathbf{R}^{-1} = \mathbf{R}^\top\). Now, to obtain the tangent space for this group, let’s take the time differential of this equation:</p> \[\begin{align} \dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top \mathbf{R} + \mathbf{R}\dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top &amp;= 0 \\ \implies \dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top \mathbf{R} &amp;= -\mathbf{R}\dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top \\ \implies \dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top \mathbf{R} &amp;= - (\dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top \mathbf{R})^\top \end{align}\] <p>This means that \(\dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top \mathbf{R}\) is skew-symmetric, and skew symmetric matrices always have the following form:</p> \[[\boldsymbol\omega]_\times = \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; -\omega_z &amp; \omega_y \\ \omega_z &amp; 0 &amp; -\omega_x \\ -\omega_y &amp; \omega_x &amp; 0\end{bmatrix}\] <p>Therefore we can write \(\dot{\mathbf{R}}^\top \mathbf{R}\) is of the form \([\boldsymbol\omega]_\times\) or</p> <p>\(\begin{align} \dot{\mathbf{R}} = \mathbf{R}[\boldsymbol\omega]_\times \label{eq:so3_lie_algebra} \end{align}\).</p> <p>When \(\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{I}\), then \(\dot{\mathbf{R}} = [\boldsymbol\omega]_\times\), which consequently means that \([\boldsymbol\omega]_\times\) the space of skew symmetric matrices forms the Lie algebra for \(\text{SO}(3)\). Finally, we observe that \([\boldsymbol\omega]_\times\) is 3 degrees of freedom by inspection, and that it can be represented as a linear combination of generators as follows:</p> \[\begin{align} [\boldsymbol\omega]_\times = \omega_x \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} + \omega_y\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} + \omega_z \begin{bmatrix}0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{bmatrix} \label{eq:so3_basis} \end{align}\] <p>if we denote these basis elements as \(\text{E}_x, \text{E}_y, \text{E}_z\) respectively, then we can denote \(\boldsymbol{\omega} = (\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\) as the vector representation of the lie algebra.</p> <p>Now, let us attempt to obtain a closed form expression for the \(\text{exp}\) map of \(\text{SO}(3)\). We see from equation (\(\ref{eq:so3_lie_algebra}\)), that we have a differential equation, where \(\dot{\mathbf{R}} = \mathbf{R} [\boldsymbol{\omega}]_\times \in T_\mathbf{R}\text{SO}(3)\). For infinitesimal time increments \(\Delta t\), we can assume that \(\omega\) is constant, then we obtain the solution to the ordinary differential equation as:</p> \[\begin{align} \int \dot{\mathbf{R}} &amp;= \int \mathbf{R}[\boldsymbol\omega]_\times \Delta t \\ \implies \mathbf{R}(t) &amp;= \mathbf{R}_{0} \text{exp}([\boldsymbol\omega]_\times \Delta t) \end{align}\] <p>If we start at the origin \(\mathbf{R}_0 = \mathbf{I}\), then we have \(\mathbf{R}(t) = \text{exp}([\boldsymbol{\omega}]_\times \Delta t)\).</p> <p>Now since \(\boldsymbol\omega\) can also be represented as a vector element (see equation (\(\ref{eq:so3_basis}\))), we can define \(\boldsymbol{\theta} \triangleq \omega \Delta t = \mathbf{u} \theta \in \mathbb{R}^3\), where \(\mathbf{u}\) is a unit vector denoting the axis of rotation, and \(\boldsymbol\theta\) denotes the rotation about said axis. It must be noted that 3-axis gyroscopes measure this angular velocity \(\omega\).</p> <p>Let us now expand the matrix exponential terms:</p> \[\begin{align} \mathbf{R} = \text{exp}([\boldsymbol\theta]_\times) = \sum_k \frac{\theta^k}{k !}([\mathbf{u}]_\times)^k \end{align}\] <p>Using the properties of skew symmetric matrices we see that \([\mathbf{u}]^0_\times = \mathbf{I}, [\mathbf{u}]^3_\times = -[\mathbf{u}]_\times, [\mathbf{u}]^3_\times = -[\mathbf{u}]^2_\times\). We can thus rewrite the series above as</p> \[\begin{align} \mathbf{R} &amp;= \mathbf{I} + [\mathbf{u}]_\times \Bigl\{ \theta - \frac{1}{3!}\theta^3 + \frac{1}{5!}\theta^5 - \dots \Bigr\} + [\mathbf{u}]_\times^2 \Bigl\{ \frac{1}{2} \theta^2 - \frac{1}{4!}\theta^4 + \frac{1}{6!}\theta^6 -\dots \Bigr\} \\ \mathbf{R} &amp;= \mathbf{I} + [\mathbf{u}]_\times \sin \theta + [\mathbf{u}]^2_\times (1 - \cos \theta) \label{eq:rodrigues} \end{align}\] <p>Where equation (\(\ref{eq:rodrigues}\)) is the closed form expression for the exponential map for \(\text{SO}(3)\) and also known as the rodrigues formula <d-cite key="rodrigues2024wiki"></d-cite> in literature.</p> <h3 id="oplus-ominus-and-the-adjoint-operators">\(\oplus\), \(\ominus\) and the Adjoint operators</h3> <p>\(\oplus\) and \(\ominus\) operators allow us to define increments on the Lie group. These combine the composition operator and the \(\text{exp}\) and \(\text{log}\) operator together. Because the composition operation on Lie groups is not commutative, we obtain two variants, \(\text{right}\) and \(\text{left}\) operators</p> \[\begin{align} \text{right}~\oplus &amp;: \mathcal{Y} = \mathcal{X} \oplus {}^\mathcal{X}\tau \triangleq \mathcal{X} \circ \text{exp}({}^\mathcal{X}\tau^\wedge) \in \mathcal{M} \label{eq:right_oplus}\\ \text{right}~\ominus &amp;: {}^\mathcal{X}\tau = \mathcal{Y} \ominus \mathcal{X} \triangleq \text{log}(\mathcal{X}^{-1}\circ \mathcal{Y})^\vee \in T_\mathcal{X}\mathcal{M} \end{align}\] <p>Notice that in the above operator \(\exp({}^\mathcal{X}\tau^\wedge)\) appears on the right side of the composition \(\circ\) operator.

To understand navigation with IMUs, let us first consider an <em>ideal</em> IMU, that can make ideal measurements accurately and precisely, <strong>without any noise</strong>. Let us specifically consider its operation in a time window between \(i\) and \(j\), and denote any arbitrary time instant within this window as \(k\). The IMU is traveling along a trajectory in the specified time window and it is both rotating and translating in space. An illustration is given in Figure 1.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ideal_imu_navigation.png" sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/ideal_imu_navigation.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: Illustration of an IMU rigidly attached to a moving body observed within a time window $i$ and $j$. $\mathbf{W}$ denotes the world frame.

An ideal gyroscope measures the angular velocity or how quickly an object is rotating about an axis, as \({}_b \omega_k\) in the body frame \(b\) and time \(k\).</p> <p>In Figure 1, as the IMU travels along the trajectory from \(i\) to \(j\), the axis of rotation changes continuously. On discretizing the time window and making the piece-wise linear approximation, we can assume that the axis of rotation remains fixed between two timesteps. Then for an instantaneous angular velocity measurement \(\boldsymbol\omega_k\) at time \(k\), the total angular change in rotation is \(\omega_k \Delta t_k^{k+1} \in \mathfrak{so}(3)\). Subsequently we can obtain the relative rotation for the time period \(k\) and \(k+1\) using the exponential map as follows: \(\Delta\mathbf{R}_k^{k+1} = \text{Exp}(\omega_k \Delta t_k^{k+1})\).</p> <p>Now assuming that the discretization \(\Delta t\) is equal, we can then compose the rotational changes between each \(\Delta t\):</p> \[\begin{align} {}_W \mathbf{R}_j &amp;= {}_W \mathbf{R}_i \text{Exp}(\omega_i \Delta t_i) \dots \text{Exp}(\omega_k \Delta t_k)\dots \text{Exp}(\omega_j \Delta t_j) \\ \implies {}_W \mathbf{R}_j &amp;= {}_W \mathbf{R}_i \prod_{k=i}^{j}\text{Exp}(\omega_k \Delta t_k) \end{align}\] <h3 id="accelerometer-and-inertial-velocity-and-position">Accelerometer and inertial velocity and position</h3> <p>Similarly, the accelerometer measures the resultant linear acceleration applied on the robot body.
