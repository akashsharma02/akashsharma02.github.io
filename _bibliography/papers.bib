    abstract = {We present a fast, scalable, and accurate Simultaneous
                Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that represents indoor
                scenes as a graph of objects. Leveraging the observation that
                artificial environments are structured and occupied by
                recognizable objects, we show that a compositional and scalable
                object mapping formulation is amenable to a robust SLAM solution
                for drift-free large-scale indoor reconstruction. To achieve this
                , we propose a novel semantically assisted data association
                strategy that results in unambiguous persistent object landmarks
                and a 2.5D compositional rendering method that enables reliable
                frame-to-model RGB-D tracking. Consequently, we deliver an
                optimized online implementation that can run at near frame rate
                with a single graphics card, and provide a comprehensive
                evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines. An open-source
                implementation will be provided at
                https://github.com/rpl-cmu/object-slam.},
