  abstract={We present a fast, scalable, and accurate Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that represents indoor scenes as a graph of objects. Leveraging the observation that artificial environments are structured and occupied by recognizable objects, we show that a compositional and scalable object mapping formulation is amenable to a robust SLAM solution for drift-free large-scale indoor reconstruction. To achieve this, we propose a novel semantically assisted data association strategy that results in unambiguous persistent object landmarks and a 2.5D compositional rendering method that enables reliable frame-to-model RGB-D tracking. Consequently, we deliver an optimized online implementation that can run at near frame rate with a single graphics card, and provide a comprehensive evaluation against state-of-the-art baselines. An open-source implementation will be provided at https://github.com/rpl-cmu/object-slam.},
